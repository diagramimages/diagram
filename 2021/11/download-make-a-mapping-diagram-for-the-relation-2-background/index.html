    <p>For instance, here we have a relation that has five ordered pairs written in set. Where the domain is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the range is the set {5, 10, 15, 20, 25} 1. A relation is a set of inputs and outputs, often written as ordered pairs (input, output). We merely plot the ordered pairs using the cartesian plane.
